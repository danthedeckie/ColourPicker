This simply uses the default GTK colour picker (which is probably the best colour picker around, though less flashy than OS X's).
If you find yourself opening Gimp or another image editor just to pick a colour for a design or whatever, this is perfect for you.

Build like so:
$ make
$ sudo make install

Then run from the commandline by typing:
$ colourpicker
